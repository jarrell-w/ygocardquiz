# A Yu-Gi-Oh! Card quiz game created with HTML, CSS, and JAVASCRIPT.

As a side project I decided to create a game based on one of my favourite franchises, Yu-Gi-Oh! The trading card game. The object of the game is to guess the proper card name.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

The current iteration is only from the firsr set as the further in sets you get the more difficult it would be to guess the card. Due to not only the card name lengths but the equally as long descriptions. I called the YGOPro Api here: https://db.ygoprodeck.com/api-guide/ using ES6 async/await function. From there I using class encapsulation.

## Possible Optimizations

I feel a way I could optimize this app is to add comments. Additionally in the future I will add new game modes, which each game mode changing each thing. The website design could also be better.

## Lessons Learned:

This project definitely solidify my understanding of working with asynchronous javascript and API's.
